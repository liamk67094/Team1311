                    <p><b>Due Date:</b><i> 12 June at 23:59</i></p>
                    <p><b>Team Name:</b> Team 1311</p>
                    <p><b>Team coordinator/Leader:</b> Liam Kennedy</p>
                    <p><b>Chosen Technology/Topic:</b> The future of employment, jobs and work through automation (Industrial Robots)</p>

                    <h3>Topic Description</h3>

                    <p>As technology advances the need of faster solutions to modern requirements escalate. Automation has been a key development 
                      in recent history through many facets including manufacturing, research and data entry collecting, delivery services and more.</p>
                      
                      <p>We chose this topic because we want to know how this persistent need of self-regulated and self-automated technology will affect 
                      societies future employment and especially our own, seeing as most of us will be dealing with the idea of automation during our 
                      prospective careers. We especially wanted to see the impact of Industrial robots have had and are continuing to have on employment 
                      since this progression of technology will see different outcomes for society, where some will greatly benefit, while others will be 
                      expendable to the constant evolution. ​</p>

                    <p>The industrial robot is a form of a machine that is automated to perform tasks in a specific industrial environment. Most common 
                      forms of industrial robot automation include welding, handling, packaging, picking, dispensing and cutting.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout the years, industrial robots have evolved to the point they are taking over jobs that required man labor in the past. 
                      The industrial robots are relevant until this day because of the lower cost, maintenance and productivity efficiency they provide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Roles</h3>

                    <p><b>Daniil (Project manager):</b> Gives general idea to how we will set up our project with a clear structure</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Casey (Time Management):</b> Sets up meeting time and keeps members liable to the work there supposed to be doing.</p>

                    <p><b>Liam (Concept design and research):</b> Creation of concepts and ideas that could be included in the assignment and website.​ Although all of us will 
                      transition between roles when needed as the project develops to evenly distribute the work load.</p>
