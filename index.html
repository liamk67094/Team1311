                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Industrial robot is a robotic arm that is automated to perform specific tasks that are hard, dangerous, or too monotonous for humans.  The arm consists of manipulator used in movement and rotation, controller regulates robot activity, and an end-effector is a device that interacts with a given task
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We chose this topic because we want to know how this persistent need of self-regulated and self-automated technology will affect societies future employment and especially our own, seeing as most of us will be dealing with the idea of automation during our prospective careers. We especially wanted to see the impact of Industrial robots have had and are continuing to have on employment since this progression of technology will see different outcomes for society, where some will greatly benefit, while others will be expendable to the constant evolution.

                            <p>Robots help increase productivity in the workplace. According to the information on International Trade Administration's website, adopting industrial robots has led to growth in productivity. Among all industries, a one percent increase in quantity correlated with an increase in productivity of 0.8 percent.   
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Industrial Robots also provide efficiency while simultaneously lowering the production costs. BCG (Boston Consulting Group), an American global management consulting firm analysis found that using advanced robots can reduce conversion costs by up to 15%, and combining advanced robotics with other technologies, process enhancements, and structural layout changes can yield savings of up to 40%.</p>

                            The growth of automation has seen an increase in oppotunity-driven/entreprenueral start ups. Where recent inventions including 3D printers, which are classified as industrial robots have seen a dramatic increase of oppotunitites in multiple industries from architectual design to the construction of prototype human brains for the use of surgical planning.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is also shown that the economy in Germany had shifted towards a more entrepreneurial economy, with self employement rate also steadily growing from 8% to 11.5% from 1991 to 2012. Although this is not single handedly down to the evolution of automation but it definetly has had an effect on the pathways for self made industries.

                            <p>As the number of industrial robot installations grow, the employment rate in industries with easily automated labour will likely begin to decline. The tasks are performed much quicker and more precisely by robots than human workers.   In the article "Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labour Markets", published by MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, the researchers found that for every robot added per 1,000 workers in the U.S., wages decline by 0.42% and the employment-to-population ratio goes down by 0.2 percentage points — to date, this means the loss of about 400,000 jobs. 
                            <br> 
                            <br>      
                            Between 1990 and 2007, the increase in robots (about one per thousand workers) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a zone by 0.39 percentage points, and average wages by 0.77%, compared to commuting zones with no exposure to robots. This implies that adding one robot to an area reduces employment in that area by about six workers.</p>
