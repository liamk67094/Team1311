                    As technology advances, the need of faster solutions to modern requirements escalate. Automation has been a key development in recent history 
                    through many facets including manufacturing, research and data entry collecting, delivery services and more.

                    <p>
                        Industrial robot is a robotic arm that is automated to perform specific tasks that are hard, dangerous, or too monotonous for humans.  
                        There are four main components that make up the robotic arm. These components are manipulator, controller, end effector and teach pendant. 
                        Manipulator is the arm that moves and rotates on various axis. Controller is the computer system that connects to the robotic arm to control 
                        its movement, rotation, and effector functions. End-effector is the device that is attached to robot’s wrist which allows it to interact with 
                        the given task. These interactions include welding, handling, packaging, picking, placing, dispensing, and cutting. The Teach Pendant is the 
                        device used to program industrial robots’ movement, rotation, and end effector function.

                    wanted to see the impact of industrial robots have had and are continuing to have on employment since this progression of technology will see different 
                    outcomes for society, where some will greatly benefit, while others will be expendable to the constant evolution.

                           <p>Robots help increase productivity in the workplace. Once a robot has been automated in an industrial environment, it can speed up production 
                            by decreasing the completion times and creating more efficient manufacturing processes which convert into more profit. According to the information 
                            on International Trade Administration's website, adopting industrial robots has led to growth in productivity. Among all industries, a one percent 
                            increase in quantity correlated with an increase in productivity of 0.8 percent.  Within the United States, industrial robot installation increased 
                            at 10.28% compound annual growth rate in the past decade, from 15,170 in 2008 to 40,373 in 2018. According to economic research analyst Kara Mazachek, 
                            it was found that parts of the industry with easily automated labor and financial resources have the most robots. These industries include automotive, 
                            transportation, metal, and wood manufacturing industries. Largest productivity gains were seen in industries where companies were in early stages of 
                            adopting robots. These industries saw 5.1 increase in productivity with an increase in industrial robot density of one percent.</p>
                    
                            <p>Industrial robots provide precise and quality work by reducing probability of human error and exhaustion. The automation increases the efficiency of 
                                production and helps ensure that the process of the function doesn’t alternate. Robots also provide efficiency while simultaneously lowering the production costs. 
                                BCG (Boston Consulting Group), an American global management consulting firm analysis found that using advanced robots can reduce conversion costs by up to 15%, 
                                and combining advanced robotics with other technologies, process enhancements, and structural layout changes can yield savings of up to 40%.

                            <p>
                            The growth of automation has seen an increase in opportunity-driven/entreprenueral start ups. Where recent inventions including 3D printers, 
                            which are classified as industrial robots have seen a dramatic increase of opportunities in multiple industries from architectual design to 
                            the construction of prototype human brains for the use of surgical planning.
                            <br>
                            It is also shown that the economy in Germany had shifted towards a more entrepreneurial economy, with self employement rate also steadily 
                            growing from 8% to 11.5% from 1991 to 2012. Although this is not single handedly down to the evolution of automation but it definetly has 
                            had an effect on the pathways for self made industries.

                            <p>As the number of industrial robot installations grow, the employment rate in industries with easily automated labour will likely begin 
                                to decline. The spread of robots, artificial intelligence, and other automation technologies has raised concerns about the future of 
                                jobs and wages. The tasks are performed much quicker and more precisely by robots than human workers.   In the article based on the impact of industrial 
                                robots on employment "Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labour Markets", published by MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, it was found that for every robot added per 1,000 
                                workers in the U.S., wages declined 0.42% and the employment-to-population ratio went down by 0.2 percentage points — to date, this means 
                                the loss of about 400,000 jobs.  Between 1990 and 2007, the increase in robots reduced the average 
                                employment-to-population ratio by 0.39 percentage points, and average wages by 0.77%, compared to commuting zones with no exposure 
                                to robots. This means that adding one robot to an area reduces employment in that area by six workers. BCG (Boston Consulting Group 2015) 
                                offers two scenarios for the next decade. In one of their scenarios, the number of robots will multiply by four by 2025. This corresponds to 5.25 
                                more robots per thousand workers in the United States, this will lead to a 1 percentage point lower employment-to-population ratio 
                                and 2 percentage points lower wage growth between 2015 and 2025. Another scenario involves three times the increase in the number of robots
                                and would have a more tolerable effect. A 0.6 percentage point decline in the employment-to population ratio and 1% lower wage growth.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Robots In Automotive Industry</h3>

                    <p>Industrial robots increase productivity in various industries that enable automated labour by increasing the speed and accuracy of the given operation. 
                        The applications of these robots can be generally categorised to welding, handling, packaging, picking, placing, dispensing, and cutting. </p>

                    <p>Automotive robotics is the area that generates the largest incorporation of industrial robots worldwide, currently covering 30% of total investments in the industry 
                        sector. Industrial robots are used in the automotive industry to increase process accuracy and annual production rates. The tasks are automated with limited human 
                        intervention which will significantly reduce the health risks for workers. An example of robot use in this industry is painting. Professional car painters are hard 
                        to find, and the job is unsafe because the paint is highly harmful to humans because of its volatile compounds that cause headaches and fatigue. The robots are 
                        striving in these areas because they reduce the health and safety risks for human workers by enabling them to work remotely and reduce the exposure to the paints’ 
                        harmful chemicals. Another application is welding.  The welding cars is used in fuel tanks, vehicle’s body, suspension, and frame. The robots create more accurate 
                        welds in a shorter period while reducing any waste and health and safety risks. The other main use of robots in automotive industry is assembling. They assemble 
                        smaller components like pumps and motors and or windshield installation and wheel mounting at high speeds. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, the robot installations in automotive industries will likely continue to increase. As new materials and new technologies are constantly being used in automotive 
                        production, these projects created a demand for the supply of the latest generation robots capable of meeting high technical requirements. This trend will continue 
                        today and despite the 2020 pandemic, it is assumed that it is not going to have a huge effect even regarding the requirements of newly opened emerging markets. It is 
                        very likely that the application of robotics will become even more desirable. The pandemic also confirmed that one of the weakest links in the production chain is a 
                        human operator. Therefore, it would be appropriate to increase the robustness of the production system to such circumstances.
